__Alpha__ known issues:

* By default users are not allowed to create operators unless explicitly given permission by a __Tercen__ administrator
* Cannot perform an operator on multi-pairwise projections
* If your local computer's date and clock time is not the same as the __Tercen__ server then you may get delays and errors
* Cannot run python scripts

The beta version of __Tercen__ is currently being tested. We are looking for beta testers. So far the feedback is positive.
Some feedback so far:

* ability to run a computation on a server of your choosing (we are currently implementing)
