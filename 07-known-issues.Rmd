# Known issues 
The alpha version of Tercen has the following known issues and limitations:

* By default users are not allowed to create operators unless explicitly given permission by a Tercen administrator
* Cannot perform an operator on multi pairwise projections
* If your local computer's date and clock time is not the same as the Tercen server then you may get delays and errors
* Cannot run python scripts

These issues are solved in the beta version scheduled to go live after summer.
