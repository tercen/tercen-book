# Getting started {#getting-started}
Here are some ideas:

* Try the [starters guide](https://tercen.github.io/starters-guide/)
* Try to code for different operators using the [`teRcen`](https://github.com/tercen/tercen) R package, Note when using R Studio, it has a useful auto-complete feature. When you have loaded the teRcen R package, the available methods for tercen client and tercen query object will automatically appear as you type.
