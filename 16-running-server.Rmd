# Running a server {#server}

If you require the on-site version of Tercen then send an email to `info@tercen.com`.
Currently the on-site versions is the beta of tercen.


## Server resources
A Tercen server allows for multiple researchers using the server. A server may be easily swamped with requests and therefore a system of resource management is in place. There are different catgories (i.e. CPU, Data, Storage, API calls) of resources and different levels of utilizaton (i.e. 0,1,2) where 0 represents the lowest level of resource utilization.

Server resources are configured using `config.yaml` file.

Go to the folder  `resources\tercen` in the Tercen installation folder, in it there is a file called `config.yaml`.

The file contains three profile levels: 0,1,2
Each user is associated with one of the levels. The default is 0 (the lowest level of resource allocation).

There are settings associated for each level for each category of resources.

The current categories are:

* Api call settings(ApiCallProfile)
* Table settings (TableProfile)
* CPU time settings (CputimeProfile)
* Data storage settings (StorageProfile)
* Run profile settings (RunProfile)

Increasing the value for any of these settings gives extra resources.

If you change these profile settings then you need to restart the Tercen application for your changes to take effect.
