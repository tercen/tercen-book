# Data Analysis {#analysis}

There are many types of analysis you can perform with __Tercen__.
To see the some example cases, please explore the __collections__.

Go to https://tercen.com/explore/tab/collections.

Each project in this page, is an example project and in each project is a workflow containing the data analyis steps. The steps usually contain a computation called an operator. For a complete list of operators see the [operator catalog](https://tercen.github.io/operator_catalog/).


Typical steps taken during an 'omics' analysis are the following:

* create or join a __team__ for the analysis
* create the new __project__ inside the team
* upload the data to the new project
* create a workflow to perform  the following
    * overview of raw data
    * quality check (outlier samples, batch effects)
    * normalization (if there is a systematic effect)
    * transformation (usually a log function)
    * exploration
        * heatmaps. PCA, tSNE, fold changes, profiles
        * clustering
    * statistical testing
        * t-test, anova
    * biological interpretation 
        * pathway analysis, enrichment analysis
        * network analysis

The parameters you adjust for are:

* kicking out samples (outliers)
* normalization or not (depends on the data)
* statistical test (t-test or anova)
    
## Overview of raw data {-}

Use a the following visuals to get an overview.

* Heatmap visuals
* Profile visuals

## Quality check (outlier samples, batch effects) {-}

There are a range of quality checks
Here are some examples:

* Heatmap visuals
* Box plots visuals

## Normalization (if there is a systematic effect) {-}

There are a range of normalization techniques
Here are some examples:

* `vsn_operator`
* `normalizer_operator`

## Transformation (usually a log function) {-}
There are a range of transformation techniques
Here are some examples:

* `log_operator`
* `asinh_operator`

## Exploration {-}
There are a range of exploration techniques
Here are some examples:

* heatmap visuals
* dimension reduction (PCA, tSNE, UMAP)
* fold changes
* profiles
* clustering

## Statistical testing {-}
There are a range of statistical techniques
Here are some examples:

* `ttest_operator`
* `anova_operator`

## Biological interpretation  {-}
There are a range of statistical techniques
Here are some examples:

* `fsgea_operator`
* pathway analysis
* network analysis
