# Data Analysis {#analysis}

Data analysis using __Tercen__ is composed of the following steps:

* create a __team__
* create a __project__
* upload the data to the project
* create a workflow to perform  the following
    * overview of raw data
    * quality check (outlier samples, batch effects)
    * normalization (if there is a systematic effect)
    * transformation (usually a log function)
    * exploration
        * heatmaps. PCA, tSNE, fold changes, profiles
        * clustering
    * statistical testing
        * t-test, anova
    * biological interpretation 
        * pathway analysis, enrichment analysis
        * network analysis

The parameters you adjust for are:

* kicking out samples (outliers)
* normalization or not (depends on the data)
* statistical test (t-test or anova)
