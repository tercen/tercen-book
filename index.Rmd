# Preface {-}

This is a book about the __Tercen__ platform and covers the motivation, design ideas, features, deployment, server administration aspects and roadmap. It is currently a draft and aims to eventually be the definitive guide to __Tercen__. It is incrementally written and changes often as we are constantly adding to the __Tercen__ project.

## Why read this book? {-}

It is the centralized knowledge of __Tercen__ in a book format. It is intended to be detailed and is aimed for researchers who require an understanding of __Tercen__. If you require a quick intro to __Tercen__ then we suggest the [starters guide](https://tercen.github.io/starters-guide2/). 

## Structure of the book {-}

The book has a chapter for each of the tool's main features. The final chapters contain additional practical information (e.g. server configuration, roadmaps).

## Acknowledgement {-}

We would like to thank all the users for their feedback about __Tercen__. It really helped us improve __Tercen__.

## Typography conventions {-}

Important terms and concepts are in __bold__ (e.g. __workflow__, __step__, __biologist__). Any element related to a user interface element is in a `code` typography (e.g. `factor` label, `ok` button).
