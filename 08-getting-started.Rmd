# Getting started
Here are some ideas:

* Try the [starters guide](https://tercen.github.io/starters-guide/)
* Try to code for different operators using the ``teRcen`` R package, Note when using RStudio it will autocomplete when you type the methods on the tercen client and tercen query object.
* Give feedback on this starters's guide by creating an [issue](https://github.com/tercen/tercen-book/issues)
* Give feedback on Tercen by sending an email to info@tercen.com
* Contact us for a one-2-one session
