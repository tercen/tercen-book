# Concepts
Spending some time on the important concepts helps in the understanding the logic behind __Tercen__.  The following questions highlight some core concepts.

## What is a measurement, variable and observation?
It may sound like an obvious questions but it goes to the heart of Tercen. It also determines how a __measurement__ is represented. Think of a laboratory instrument generating __measurements__, say a protein or gene value `mt`, and each __measurement__ has an annotation context, i.e. sample name (`sn`), temperature(`tm`), time(`ti`), Ph (`Ph`) etc. So each `mt` (i.e. a __measurement__) is annotated with many other values `sn`, `tm`, `ti`, `Ph`. Describing `mt` can be done by using a long format such as:

`mt`| `sn`  |`tm` |`ti` |`Ph` |
:---| :---- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
2.3 | sample1 |37 |60 | 7.7|
4.1 | sample2 |37 |70 | 8.0|
2.0 | sample3 |37 |80 | 7.0|

Each row represents an __observation__. This format may seem verbose but it is `measurement` centric and comes with the complete annotation of each `measurement` (i.e. rows). Tercen uses such a row like structure itself. Each __measurement__ is recorded with a full experimental context of annotation values. A __varaible__ is `mt`. In the above example there is one __variable__ `mt`, three __observations__, and three __measurements__. 

In Tercen __measurements__ are usually on the y-axis of most projection views (defined by the cross-tab window) and the others are used to define the row, col, x-axis etc. 

Statistician traditionally use column headers to describe a __variable__ and rows to describe an __observation__. The Tercen data model allows the __measurement__, __variable__ and __observation__ to be positioned anywhere (col, row, x-axis, y-axis, color, label) and therefore there is great flexibility. However most Tercen operators require to know what is the __variable__ in order to compute the appropriate results. Therefore we have adopted the convention of using __variable__ on the row. This is inspired by the genomics world where the gene (i.e. a __variable__) is a row and the samples are the __observation__. Most Tercen operators or apps use the row as a __variable__ and columns as __observations__ and the y-axis for the __measurement__. The documentation associated with the operator indicates what the operator is expecting in terms of position and input. Note, there are operators which do not follow these conventions.

## What is a step, app and workflow?
Typically, researchers perform many computations on their measurements. Tercen supports this by having the concepts of step, apps and workflows. An individual __step__ is a projection and potentially a computation of the data. Projections are defined visually using the cross-tab window associated with a __step__. A  __workflow app__ is composed of several __steps__. A __workflow__ is composed of several __apps__ and __steps__.

## What is visual computation?
It allows researchers to define a visual projection of the data, this projection also defines the computation to be executed. This done by interacting with the Tercen cross-tab window. For those readers who are interested, these projections are in fact using a __universal table__ and __relational algebra__ (see below). 

## What is an universal table and __relational algebra__?
A researcher avoids complexity by using the Tercen's universal table concept. A __universal table__ is essentially an abstract table. It presents itself as one table even though underneath it is composed of several actual tables. The __universal table__ allows Tercen to always represent a unified data model throughout the Tercen workflow and visual projections. The underlying tables are all linked using __relational algebra__.
The researchers can make these sophisticated relationships without requiring to understand __relational algebra__.
