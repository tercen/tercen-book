# Sharing analysis {#sharing-analysis}

All entities in Tercen, i.e. data, steps, views, workflows, groups, projects are shared via a permanent URL.

If sharing a URL is not possible for whatever reasons then a researcher exports a workflow as zip file. This zip file is sent to the other researchers which imports the workflows.
