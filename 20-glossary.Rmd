__Measurement__: A numerical variable

__Observation__: An observation is the factor name given to a value (measurement), at a particular moment in time, of a particular variable.

__Variable__: A variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed that may assume more than one of a set of values to which a numerical measure or a category from a classification can be assigned (e.g. income, age, weight, etc., and “occupation”, “industry”, “disease”, etc.

__Cross-tab window__:
A Tercen interface window to define a projection view (i.e. what is on the: row, col, y-axis, x-axis, color, label).

__Projection__:
A projection is defined using the __cross-tab window__.

__Long format__:
A format where every row is a measurement.

__Wide format__:
A format where every column is a variable.

__App__:
A plug-in to Tercen. It can be an __operator__, __step__, __workflow app__, or __workflow__.

__App library__:
A repository of Tercen __apps__. There are many repository locations, (e.g. github, team library). 

__workflow__.
A sequence of __steps__ or __apps__ to achieve an analysis pipeline.

__Workflow app__:
A small workflow composed of __steps__, visuals and __operators__. Typically it achieves one task, e.g. PCA app. The PCA app is composed of one result visual and one computation and one data wrangling step.

__Step__:
A single step allows for a visual __projection__ and optionally a computation using an __operator__.

__Operator__:
An operator computes on data supplied to it by the __projection__ view defined using the __cross-tab window__.
