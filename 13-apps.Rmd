# Apps (i.e. plug-ins) {#apps}
An app is a plug-in and allows the researcher to customize __Tercen__ with the latest algorithms and visualizations. There are currently three __app types__: __operators__ (e.g. mean, pca, t-test), __steps__ (e.g. two group comparison, pca), and __workflows__ (e.g. RNAseq). Each __app__ has an __app version__ and is located in a __app library__. 

The three types of __apps__ with some examples:

* an __operator app__ 
    + e.g. pca function
* a __step app__
    + e.g. a combination of a pca and visuals
* a __workflow app__
    + e.g RNAseq pipeline workflow

An __operator app__ performs a computation on the projection views in the cross-tab window. A __step app__ is a mini workflow and allows a researcher to perform a set of computations and/or visualizations. A __workflow app__ is type of template allows a researcher to start a complete standard analysis defined by a template (e.g. a RNAseq workflow). 

Typically a __workflow app__ contains __step apps__ and a __step app__ contains __operators apps__.
As an example there may be a RNAseq __workflow app__ in which there is a pca __step app__ containing a pca __operator app__. The  pca step performs the pca __operator__ but in addition it supplies useful pre-defined views.

There are many existing __operator apps__ but it is easy to create your own operator and wrapped it up as an __app__. Using the data step, a user creates a projection and selects an __operator__. A data projection is composed of a __data__, __y-axis__, __x-axis__, __rowseq__, __colseq__, __color__ and __label__. All these projection parameter are presented by data structures to the __operator__.


## App libraries {-}

There is more than one app library. However the main publically available library is called the __Tercen app library__. The other app libraries have different location and permission levels.

Library  | Location|Permission level |
:-----   | :------- |:------- |
Tercen app library | tercen github| Public |
Site app library   | tercen server| Site only|
My app library     | tercen project area | Project only |
 

A __site__ is a Tercen server installed on a machine at an installation  site.

A library consists of a set of __apps__ and their __versions__.

__Tercen app library:__

All public Tercen operators and apps are on a tercen github. 

The contents of the public Tercen app library are found in a json file in [github app library](https://github.com/tercen/app-library)

The public operators and apps are also found on the Tercen area, see (https://github.com/tercen)

## Installing apps {-}

A researcher installs an app by sourcing it from any of the libraries (tercen app library, site library, my library) or from a git repository.


## Structure of an operator app {-}
A Tercen operator is composed of three main activities:

* Getting the data
* Operating on the data
* Returning the results

The data is contained in each data step. Each data step contain the data in 
three main tables:

* Row table
* Column table
* Cross-tab table

Each table contains different data as a result of the definition of the cross-tab projection.

The cross-tab table contains the following important columns, as examples:

``.ri``  row index of data, represented by an integer

``.ci``  col index of data, represented by an integer


## Tercen R package {-}
There is currently an R package in the tercen repository to help in creating operators called [teRcen](https://github.com/tercen/teRcen) 

## Creating an operator app {-}
Tercen allows programmers to easily build new operators from the comfort of their favorite interactive development environment (IDE). From the IDE it is possible to access all Tercen features. Access the input data and returning results is essential when developing your __operator app__ in the IDE on your local machine.  

The ability to create a new Tercen operator requires basic programming skills and is straight forward.

Here is a development process to create an __operator app__:

__Getting setup__:

* Install R
* Install R Studio
* Install the [teRcen R package](https://github.com/tercen/teRcen)
* Open R Studio and create an empty project and init the git
* Copy four files into project, you can find them in any operator in tercen github.
    + `operator.json`
    + `main.R`
    + `README.md`
    + `.gitignore`
* Modify appropriately each of the files 
* Create  the `workspace.R` file by:
    + Copy `main.R` and rename to `workspace.R` file
    + Add the following lines to `workspace.R` file:
```
source('~/.Rprofile')
options("tercen.workflowId"= "76a4dcffd551802fd23d42bd862e8300")
options("tercen.stepId"= "3-2")
```
The values indicated above are examples. The real values come from the next section

__Writing and testing the operator app__:

* Develop and test the __operator app__ within the `workspace.R` file
* Determine the input data for the __operator app__
    + Go to Tercen and configure a project view in cross-tab window of the __data step__
    + Record the __stepId__ and __workflowId__ of this __data step__
    + Get data using the tercen api `tercen::ctx$select`
    + Execute the __operator app__ locally 
    + Push results back to Tercen using the tercen API `tercen::ctx$save`
  
The actions above may happen multiple times as you develop your operator. Once the __operator app__ is finalized then proceed:

__Deploy the operator__:

* Modify `workshop.R` and copy it to `main.R` 
* Run `packrat::init`
This can always re-init packrat by performing the following
    + Remove the `packrat` folder in the Rstudio project folder
    + Remove the `.Rprofile` file in the project folder
    + Run `packrat::init` again
* upload to github in a public repository, let call it the operator git repo.

You can now install your __operator__  into your Tercen server via the github install menu from the __site library__ or any __project library__ 
If you want it available to the Tercen community send an email to Tercen.
Tercen administrator makes it available by modify app library on tercen github.

__Content of `.Rprofile:` file in your home directory__ 
```
options("tercen.serviceUri"="http://127.0.0.1:5400/api/v1/")
options("tercen.username"="XXXX")
options("tercen.password"="YYYY")
```
where `XXXX` and `YYYY` are the appropriate username and password of the developer.

## Creating a step app {-}
* Make a workflow first
* Save the workflow
* Set the property of the workflow to “step”
* Download the zip of the __step app__
* Unzip the folder
* Add `README.md` file
* Add `.gitignore` file
* Create a git repository for the new __step app__
* Upload the files to the new __step app__ git repository


## Creating a workflow app {-}
* Make a workflow first
* Save the workflow
* Set the property of the workflow to "workflow"
* Download the zip of the  __workflow app__
* Unzip the folder
* Add `README.md` file
* Add `.gitignore` file
* Create a git repository for the new __workflow app__ git repository
* Upload the files to the new __workflow app__ git repository

## App examples {-}

__Operator app examples:__

An __operator app__ which performs computation follows either one of the following computing pattern :

* per cell
* per row
* per col
* per row and col
