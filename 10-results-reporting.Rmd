Tercen core architecture contains a rich amount information about the data analysis workflow. For example, Tercen know the relationship of any computed data with the source data (see chapter \@ref(data-provenance)), this is ideal information when creating a report on exactly what is computed and how.

There is a concept of `README.md` file for each project. It allows you to quickly create some documentation for the project.

To create a `README.md` file for a project, perform the following

* Go to the project folder
* Create a file using the New file button
* Name the file `README.md`
* Save it

Voila, you have an empty README.

You can edit it anytime using the edit button, the syntax for the markdown is the standard syntax. Currently, we support the following markdown syntax:

```
# Section

## Subsection
```
To embed a view of one of the workflow's data step use the following syntax.

```
<div workflowId="4d2ce64e3312592700d1d36dabe7c404" stepId="de008572-2b81-4a4e-9681-cad765c675ab"></div>
```

Replace the hexadecimal numbers (e.g. 4d2ce64e3312592700d1d36dabe7c404) of the workflowId and stepId to the one which contains the data step you wish to connect with.
