# Results reporting {#results-reporting}

The ability to publish results for scientific journals or even group presentation is key.
The current version of beta implements a high quality image output. Any __data step__ allows the researcher to export a high quality image as a `*.png`.

Tercen core architecture contains a rich amount information about the data analysis workflow. For example, Tercen know the relationship of any computed data with the source data (see chapter \@ref(data-provenance)), this is ideal information when creating a report on exactly what is computed and how.

The final release of __Tercen__ is targeted to have a full reporting subsystem in order to convert __workflows__ into reports or methodology section of publications.
