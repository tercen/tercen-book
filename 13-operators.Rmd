# Operators and Apps {#operators}

Tercen operators perform the computation on the projection views. An operator performs a computation on one projection. An app is a mini workflow allow a user to perform a computation or visualization.

There are many existing operators but it is easy to create your own operator. Using the data step, a user creates a projection and selects an operator. A data projection is composed of a __data__, __y-axis__, __x-axis__, __rowseq__, __colseq__, __color__ and __label__. All these projection parameter are presented by data structures to the operator.



## App libraries {-}

The main standard Tercen library is called, __Tercen app library__, however the full list of standard library locations are: 

* Tercen app library (located on tercen github)
* Site library (located on tercen server)
* My library (located in the project)

The differences between the different libraries is their location and their permission.

Library  | Permission level |
:----- | :------- |
Tercen library | Public |
Site library   | Site only|
My library     | Project only |

A site, here is a Tercen server installed on a machine at an installation site.

A library consists of a set of:

* Operator
* Apps
* Workflows

__Tercen app library:__

All public Tercen operators and apps are on tercen github. 

The contents of the public Tercen app library are found in a json file in [github app library](https://github.com/tercen/app-library)

The public operators and apps are also found on the Tercen github area, see (https://github.com/tercen)

## Installing apps {-}

A researcher installs an app by sourcing it from any of the libraries (tercen app library, site library, my library) or from a git repository.


## Structure of an operator {-}
A Tercen operator is composed of three main activities:

* Getting the data
* Operating on the data
* Returning the results

The data is contained in each data step. Each data step contain the data in 
three main tables:

* Row table
* Column table
* Cross-tab table

Each table contains different data as a result of the definition of the cross-tab projection.

The cross-tab Table contains the following important columns, as examples:

``.ri``  row index of data, represented by an integer

``.ci``  col index of data, represented by an integer


## Tercen R package {-}
There is currently an R package in the tercen repository to help in creating operators called [teRcen](https://github.com/tercen/teRcen)
