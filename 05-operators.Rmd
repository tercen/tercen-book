# Operators
Tercen operators perform the computation on the projection views. There are many existing operators but it is easy to create your own operator. Using the data step, a user creates a projection and selects an operator. A data projection is composed of a __data__, __y-axis__, __x-axis__, __rowseq__, __colseq__, __color__ and __label__. All these projection parameter are presented by data structures to the operator

## Structure of an operator
A Tercen operator is composed of three main activities:

* Get data
* Operate on data
* Return results

All the projection parameters are available as data frames:
For the data itself Tercen supplies three variables.

``.rowseq``  row sequence of data, represented by an integer

``.colseq``  col sequence of data, represented by an integer

``.id``      id sequence of data (will be deprecated), represented by an integer


## Simple operator
A simple identity operator is shown

## Mean, Sum, Count operator
A simple Mean, Sum, Count operator is outlined

## T-test operator

## Bioconductor operator

## R package
There is currently an R package in the tercen repository to help in creating operators called ``tercen:rtercen``
