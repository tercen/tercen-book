## Standard relational algebra
The terminology:

A relationship is a table.

Relation(a,b)   (i.e. a Table containing two columns a and b)
```
R(a,b)
```

Each row is unique.

What are the standard relational algebra operations


## Tercen relational algebra

Representing the `gather` operation as unions:

```
Gather = Union(RenameVar(a,value,R(a)), RenameVar(b,value,R(b)))

R(a,b)
CR(mean,a)
UniversalR = Join(R,CR,[a])
CR2(median,b,a)
UnivR2 = Join(UnivR, CR2, [a,b])

UnivR3 = Gather(UnivR2, var, value,[median,mean])
```

The tercen optimizer:

```
Simplify(query,UnivR3) = CR
```
