# Introduction

## Motivation {-}

Tercen  promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to,  but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place.
Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and  day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase:

> Tercen __empowers__ the biologist and __liberates__ the bioinformatician.

## Challenges {-}

__Analysis time__

Researchers are spending more time performing analysis.

__Control__

Researchers want control back.

__Ratio__

The ratio between the programmers vs non programmers can be large.

__Harmony__

We require to get harmony back between the researchers.
