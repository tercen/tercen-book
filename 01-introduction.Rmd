# Introduction

## Motivation {-}

Tercen  promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to,  but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place.
Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and  day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase:

> Tercen __empowers__ the biologist and __liberates__ the bioinformatician.

## Challenges {-}

__Large Analysis time__

Researchers are spending more time performing analysis.

__Large data sets__

Researchers want to interact with large data sets. 

__Ratio__

The ratio between the programmers vs non-programmers can be large.

__Control__

Researchers want control of their data. 


## Way forward {-}

The way forward is to get researchers back in control of their data. New tools and approaches are required.

__Harmony__

A more harmonious state between the programmers and non-programmers.
