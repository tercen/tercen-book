# Running a server {#server}

If you require the on-site version of Tercen then send an email to `info@tercen.com`.
Currently the on-site versions is the __beta__ of Tercen.


## Server resources {-}
A Tercen server allows for multiple researchers using the same server. Each researcher is using CPU and Storage resources. A server may be easily swamped with requests and therefore a system of resource management is in place. There are different categories (i.e. CPU, Data, Storage, API calls) of resources and different levels of utilization (i.e. 0,1,2) where 0 represents the lowest level of resource utilization. Ideally the right level of resources should be assigned for different users. A researcher who exceeds their limit gets an error. A resource utilization information bar is shown to each user in the graphical user interface. The bar indicates the level of resource utilization and the amount left.  

Server resources are configured using `config.yaml` file.

Go to the folder named `resources\tercen` in the Tercen installation folder (usually `C:\Tercen`), in it there is a file called `config.yaml`.

The file contains three profile levels: 0,1,2
Each user is associated with one of the levels. The default is 0 (the lowest level of resource allocation).

Level  | Resource |
:----- | :------- |
0      | Low amount of resources |
1      | Medium amount of resources |
2      | Highest amount of resources |


There are settings associated for each level for each category of resources.

The current categories are:

Category  | Description | Name in yaml file
:-----    | :-------    | :-------  
Table     | resource  for table (i.e. size)  | `TableProfile`
CPU time  | resources for CPU time  | `CputimeProfile`
Storage   | resources for storage   | `StorageProfile`
Run       | resources for a run     | `RunProfile`
API calls | resources fro the API   | `ApiCallProfile`

Increasing the value for any of these settings gives extra resources.

If you change these profile settings then you need to restart the Tercen application for your changes to take effect.
