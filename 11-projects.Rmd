# Team Projects {#projects}

Science is performed by teams in the context of research projects. Both concepts are integrated into __Tercen__. Researchers are member of a __team__. The __team__ creates __project__. The __project__ determines what type of __data__ and __workflows__ the team work on for the research study. Without a __project__ a researcher cannot upload data or create a __workflow__.

A __team__ is:

* created by a __user__
* composed of members, a set of __users__ (i.e. researchers)
* a library (i.e. set) of __apps__ (called __library__)

A __project__ is:

* created by a __team__
* a set of __data__ (i.e. __tables__)
* a set of __workflows__

A __user__ (i.e. researcher) may be a member of many __teams__ and therefore access many __projects__.
