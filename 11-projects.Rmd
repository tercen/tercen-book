# Team Projects {#projects}

Science is performed by teams on research projects. Both concepts are integrated into __Tercen__. Reseachers are member of a __team__. The __team__ creates __project__. The __project__ determines what type of __data__ and __workflows__ the team work on for the research study. Without a __project__ a researcher cannot upload data or create a __workflow__.

In summary, a __project__ is:

* created by a __team__
* a set of __data__ (i.e. __tables__)
* a set of __workflows__
* a set of __apps__ (called an __app library__)

A reasearcher may be a member of many __teams__ and __projects__.
