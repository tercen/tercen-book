# Projects {#projects}

Science is project based and therefore concept of a _project_ is integrated into Tercen. The _project_ determines what group members work on. Data and workflows are created within a project. Without a project a researcher cannot upload data or create a workflow.

In summary, a project is:
* a set of members
* a set of member permissions
* a set of data
* a set of workflows
* a set of apps
* a set of operators

A reasearcher may be a member of many projects.
