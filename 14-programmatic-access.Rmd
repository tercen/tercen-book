# Programmatic access {#programmatic-access}
Researchers who wish to interact with Tercen programmatically can do so. Any functionality available graphically in Tercen is also available programmatically. This powerful capability means researchers can automate the following:

* automate the uploading data
* automate the creation of workflows
* automate the execution of workflows (i.e. piplines)
* automate the creation of teams and users
* automate the creation of projects
* automate the creation of operators

Tercen itself auto-generates these API for the different programming languages. At the moment we auto-generated a package for the R programming language. We will rapidly auto-generate for Python and Matlab very soon (before summer of 2018). if you have an immediate need, do not hesistate to contact us by email to `info@tercen.com` with the request.

The [`teRcen`](https://github.com/tercen/teRcen)  R package on the Tercen github allows complete programmatic control. For the full API please refer to the [teRcen R package](https://github.com/tercen/teRcen)
