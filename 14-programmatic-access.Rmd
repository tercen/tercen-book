# Programmatic access {#programmatic-access}
Researchers who wish to interact with Tercen programmatically to, for example, automate a Tercen analysis pipeline. Tercen auto-generates these API for the different programming languages. At the moment we auto-generated a package for the R programming language. We will rapidly auto-generate for Python and Matlab very soon (before summer of 2018).

The [`teRcen`](https://github.com/tercen/teRcen)  R package on the Tercen github allows complete programmatic control. Any functionality available graphically in Tercen is also available pro grammatically. This includes, for example:

* uploading data
* computing data
* auto-generate a workflow
* execute a workflow
* creating groups and users
* creating projects
* creating operators

For the full API please refer to the [teRcen R package](https://github.com/tercen/teRcen)
