# Visual computation {#visual-computation}
Researchers want to control the data they generate. Hence easily performing any computing on the data is key. In a previous chapter we discussed the cross tab window. Its flexibility and interactability are important features to create any visualization the researcher desires. The __cross tab window__ is also capable of computing, in what we call **WYSIWYC**, **W** hat **Y**ou **S**ee **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **C**ompute.

Every view is potentially a computation. You require to select an __operator__ to compute on the choosen projection. 

Note: Some operators requrie a specific projection e.g. a PCA requires to have observations on the `columns` and variables on the `rows`.
