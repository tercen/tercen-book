# Data provenance {#data-provenance}

Data provenance allows researchers to take a computed value and trace back to the original data sources to investigate how a value was computed.

This is a fundamental aspect of reproducible science.

The data model of Tercen is fundamentally built on data relationships and therefore has data provenance built into it. 

In the final version of Tercen we aim to offer researchers the ability to interrogate any value and show the full computed trace stack for it.
