# Data provenance {#data-provenance}
Reproducible science necessitates knowing how all computed values where in fact computed. This ability is at the hart of the methodology section in a publication.
Data provenance allows researchers to take a computed value and trace back to the original data sources to investigate how a value was computed.

This is a fundamental aspect of reproducible science.

The data model of __Tercen__ is fundamentally built on data relationships and therefore has data provenance built into it. 

In the final version of __Tercen__ we aim to offer researchers the ability to interrogate any value and show the full computed trace stack for it.
