# Deployment {#deployment}

Deployment is the manner in which Tercen is delivered to the researchers. Currently is available in two major deliveries: cloud and on-site. Each type is expained below with a brief description of some of the flavours available.

## Cloud
When Tercen is running on servers in a remote data center, we consider this to a __cloud deployment__. There is a __cloud deployment__ called __TercenCloud__. It is aimed for the public and is currently free. A private __TercenCloud__ is also available but requires a request.

__Public Cloud__

The __TercenCloud__ is found at: (http://www.tercen.com).
Currently the cloud is running the alpha version of __Tercen__. It will be shortly upgraded.

## On-site

Currently the on-site version are the beta version of tercen.

__Desktop on-site__

The desktop version is for a local on-site install on a user's machine. This version is still capable of being a server to a group of users.
